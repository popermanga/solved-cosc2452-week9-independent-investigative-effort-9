   <td width="748">5. This week’s programming task will cover concepts required by Assignment 3. You should aim to get the help of your tutors and make further revisions.<strong>Coding exercise steps (Hint: Need help? Ask your tutor via Canvas→Discussions→”IIE08″):</strong>Complete the 25/Jan/2021 solution first as this extends upon that work. Next follow Canvas→<a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/modules">Modules→Week 9</a> where the topics of creating multiple classes is continued. <strong>Your tutors will provide further explanations on these general topics and how they relate to this IIE during their weekly “tutor chats”</strong>. Please also follow the announcement ‘<a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/discussion_topics/1039805">How to debug large programs and get help on</a> <a href="https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/70691/discussion_topics/1039805">debugging…</a>’a) In this week’s IIE, modify <u>your own adaptation</u> of the IIE08 student manager (which has to be different to the student manager) so that, instead of having multiple arrays to the different fields of a record (e.g. name, age, etc. of a student), a single array is created of a class that you have created (e.g. Student).The class that you create (e.g. Student) should follow naming conventions for classes as given in class materials. The fields should now be private object member variables of the students but these must not be arrays.You must also think of what should be constructor parameters.<em>[Side note: The concepts of packages, polymorphism, inheritance (parent-child/super class-sub class relationships), abstract classes, interfaces, etc. are not covered in Intro To Programming and therefore <u>must not be used</u> in assessments. Subsequent courses such as Programming 1, </em><em>Further Programming, etc. will cover these in detail.]</em></td>
